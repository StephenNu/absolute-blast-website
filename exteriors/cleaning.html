Dealing with structures and surfaces that have become coated with undesirable residues and surfaces that need reconfiguring and resurfaced doesn't always mean an abrasive method of cleaning but perhaps another less surface impacting system or a chemically cleaned method.
</p>

<p>
Our clients have called upon us to deal with oil spills, stinking garbage residue and graffiti on new stucco and we can handle it all without damaging the surfaces underneath.
</p>
<p>
It takes skill and experience and our crews are experts at it but always have the back up of the Historic Facade Restoration Guild if they need help. Not damaging your building or surface is of prime importance and as usual a test clean is done and a job stops if the team is unhappy with the result. Plan "B" and back to the drawing board are part of the scheme....what's not part of the scheme is wreaking someone's project. We will tell you to "just paint it" if we feel that is the right solution.
</p>
<p>
Constantly investing in new and better equipment is just a sign of a growing successful company and Absolute Blast Corp. is always upgrading their sandblasting equipment, safety equipment and keeping the crews up to date with the right certifications and training. Paramount to Absolute Blast Corp. is it's people. Our crews are typically young family men with strong work ethics and standards who know the company is them. And with that outlook they do their utmost to see that our jobs are done right and you the customer are more than satisfied.
