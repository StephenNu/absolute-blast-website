          <h2>Historic Restoration</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
Our history is disappearing with every disappointing "renovation" done badly and in ignorance of the requirements of keeping our built heritage as a testament to our fore-bearer's lives and world for our own future generations to see.
Sandblasting is one of the villains of the piece as untrained operators seeking a quick return and are known especially as destroyers of old brick buildings. Even our local Dundurn Castle a fine historic and world famous building has been recently vandalized by a sandblaster who ruined the architraves of the windows.
Seeing this sort of disasters happening just about everywhere the principles of Absolute Blast Corp. were instigators of forming The Heritage Facade Restoration Guild and as such have a vested interest in local history preservation.
As "membership hath it advantages" the methodology and training of how to deal with historic facades  has been learned from the beginning and now our team can deal with brick restoration, Abraton  wood and concrete restoration and many other applications including the unexpected skills in removing graffiti from that most modern of surfaces....the new stucco which is the surface choice of all sorts of new buildings with out damaging it.

Having dealt with many historic buildings from The Old CNR Hamilton Train Station and it's Michigan Sandstone  to the clean up of the Dundas School of Art and it's old beams and pillars dating from the old factory at its centre we have had a great time. Now we keep dealing with stone, brick and wood surfaces using the world famous Rotec Vortex Cleaning System  from Europe for sensitive work.  
As for our crews : Our crews have the required years of experience plus with the mentor-ship of our technicians  to keep your job done right. Cleaning and restoring  whether on an old house or a heritage public building is always a good challenge which our crews keenly like to take on.

Constantly investing in new and better equipment is just a sign of a growing successful company and Absolute Blast Corp. is always upgrading their sandblasting equipment, safety equipment and keeping the crews up to date with the right certifications and training. Paramount to Absolute Blast Corp. is it's people. Our crews are typically young family men with strong work ethics and standards who know the company is them. And with that outlook they do their utmost to see that our jobs are done right and you the customer are more than satisfied.
