          <h2>Confined Spaces</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
ertification and experience are the two most important elements in confined space work especially blasting with high pressure hoses and sharp heavy media. The next word is teamwork. Our crews are keenly aware of the dangers of blasting in small spaces and work together to be safe and diligent in getting the job done in good time and done right.</p><p>
All our safety equipment is of the latest design and usually quite new. From helmets to air supply and communication we don't stint on the lives and health of the men. Each job is carefully planned and implemented to make it so. Some jobs though very few we won't do if we see that the aforementioned is impossible to provide.  Our customers are relying on this care and we always get a happy result for them and ourselves in a job done well, safely and on time.</p><p>
Our types of blasting are based on the standards of our coatings suppliers and will always be designated by the degree of surface preparation required for the materials we are using. The basic standards for preparing metal substrates are a joint effort between the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers International (NACE). A list of standards can be found <a href="http://protective.sherwin-williams.com/pdf/tools-charts-list/surface_preparation_standards.pdf">here</a>, while 
SSPC-SP5 / NACE 1 White Metal Blast Cleaning,  SSPC-SP6 / NACE 3 Commercial Blast Cleaning,
SSPC-SP7 / NACE 4 Brush-Off Blast Cleaning are just a few of the standards specified and to which we adhere. Our crews can get you the finish you desire and get it painted as per your needs quickly and on time.</p><p>
As for our crews : Our crews have the required years of experience plus with the mentor-ship of our technicians to keep your job done right.     </p><p>
