          <p>Blasting with grit or dry ice or what ever media is required inside any closed interior takes blasting to a different level. Usually an interior blast is done in a stripped out space on new construction or renovation or inside some big piece of equipment. However when doing the hallways of a fully functioning school or a piece of equipment trapped inside an operating factory with delicate product and machinery exposed to any media drift, that's when Absolute Blast Corp comes in. Care and expertise are paramount in sandblasting etc in such situations.  Our crews have done some amazing feats in keeping customers like the Toronto Catholic School Board and others happy. Working with insurance restoration companies like Paul's Restoration, First General, Service Master and Paul Davis Systems means we get to do some rather unique situations where all our skills and equipment are brought to the fore dealing with keeping the job dust free, on schedule, properly done, and to Ministries of Safety and Environment  standards. Hours of prep work for the protection of materials both inside the site and outside is the norm for a properly done interior blast job. Triple sealed doors, negative air systems powered by large exhaust fans and built to site temporary blast enclosures are just some of the weapons in our arsenal to keep a job safe and well done.</p><p>
Our types of blasting are based on the standards of our coatings suppliers and will always be designated by the degree of surface preparation required for the materials we are using. The basic standards for preparing metal substrates are a joint effort between theSociety for Protective Coatings (SSPC) and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers International (NACE). A list of standards can be found <a href="http://protective.sherwin-williams.com/pdf/tools-charts-list/surface_preparation_standards.pdf">here</a>, while
SSPC-SP5 / NACE 1 White Metal Blast Cleaning,  SSPC-SP6 / NACE 3 Commercial Blast Cleaning,
SSPC-SP7 / NACE 4 Brush-Off Blast Cleaning are just a few of the standards specified and to which we adhere. Our crews can get you the finish you desire and get it painted as per your needs quickly and on time.</p><p>
As for our crews : Our crews have the required years of experience plus with the mentor-ship of our technicians  to keep your job done right.    
Constantly investing in new and better equipment is just a sign of a growing successful company and Absolute Blast Corp. is always upgrading their sandblasting equipment, safety equipment and keeping the crews up to date with the right certifications and training. Paramount to Absolute Blast Corp. is it's people. Our crews are typically young family men with strong work ethics and standards who know the company is them. And with that outlook they do their utmost to see that our jobs are done right and you the customer are more than satisfied.
