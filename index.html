				<h2>Welcome to Absolute Blast Mobile SandBlasting!</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Sandblasting is probably the dirtiest and most dangerous occupation in the renovation; restoration trades only out done by explosive demolition work.
					The dangers of the work and the danger of damaging projects is not to be taken lightly and is certainly not something to be considered by amateurs.
					To sandblast properly is a skill that takes time to learn and is only taught on site by other experienced sandblasters.
					It is very much a one on one teaching method.
					Absolute Blast has trained its team in the art of cleaning and all the safety aspects needed in mobile sandblasting for the last seven years and is proud of the effort and proud of the young men who have achieved the proficiency that is required in the mobile sandblasting field.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This is especially important when our mobile blast work takes us into heritage restoration work where delicate substrates as in soft brick cleaning have to be considered as in fire restoration or mould removal.
					Being part of the Heritage Facade Restoration Guild has put our team in a standard of their own.
					There are constant improvements in training and equipment as the heritage restoration field sees new and better methods being introduced.
					The Rotec Systems (AKA as the JOS System) are now coming to the fore in the Southern Ontario area as architects and heritage groups see the wisdom of having qualified people clean their projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					All this from graffiti removal, monument restoration to heavy equipment cleaning using soda, soft media, walnut, dry ice, wet blasting plus power washing and with a painting crew to deal with what ever you need ABSOLUTE BLAST CO. is Southern Ontarioâ€™s choice in sandblasting and building cleaning contractors, make it yours.
