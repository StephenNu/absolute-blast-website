          <p>
Heavy equipment whether stationary or movable represents a huge investment in money and time. Keeping such equipment in good order so that it retains it's value and continues to operate well is a sensible husbandry of resources. One of the prime failures with heavy equipment is letting it look tired and dirty. Rust can eat away pieces entirely devaluing and eventually destroying such equipment.  Then in other situations as in getting mineral deposits etc. off machinery can give years of extended life to a machine and make it return to be the efficient equipment it once was.</p><p>
Some heavy equipment operates in extreme conditions as in salt mines or out on the roads in winter which is probably worse! Here good coatings to protect the pieces is important and what is even more important is the preparation for what ever paint or vinyl being used.  The various standards of blasting are used to make sure that the new finish adheres to the surface by giving the surface a rough indented profile to a smooth glowing finish according to the specifications of the manufacturer and technical advisers.</p><p>
Our types of blasting are based on the standards of our coatings suppliers and will always be designated by the degree of surface preparation required for the materials we are using. The basic standards for preparing metal substrates are a joint effort between the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers International (NACE). A list of standards can be found <a href="http://protective.sherwin-williams.com/pdf/tools-charts-list/surface_preparation_standards.pdf">here</a>, while
SSPC-SP5 / NACE 1 White Metal Blast Cleaning,  SSPC-SP6 / NACE 3 Commercial Blast Cleaning,
SSPC-SP7 / NACE 4 Brush-Off Blast Cleaning are just a few of the standards specified and to which we adhere. Our crews can get you the finish you desire and get it painted as per your needs quickly and on time.</p><p>
As for our crews : Our crews have the required years of experience plus with the mentor-ship of our technicians  to keep your job done right.</p><p>        
Constantly investing in new and better equipment is just a sign of a growing successful company and Absolute Blast Corp. is always upgrading their sandblasting equipment, safety equipment and keeping the crews up to date with the right certifications and training.
