Maritime business are keenly aware of the issues of maintenance for “Only the best is fit to go to sea” is more than a saying. Lives depend on keeping a “tight ship” and water and salt love to rust steel, rot wood and weaken fibreglass. The fight to keep a modern ship afloat and making a profit for her owners is never ending until the day she is scrapped, a day no owner wants to see happen for want of maintenance.
Absolute Blast Corp. is situated close to the busiest port on the Great Lakes, Hamilton Ont. and  have close ties to the port through business there and the local Seafarer's Mission which we support.
In this regard we have been asked to blast everything from small yachts to oil tankers and more.<p></p>
Proximity to the water is always a challenge in that residue from the cleaning can't be allowed to get into the marine environment which is shared by a variety of aquatic life even in the dirtiest of commercial slips. Our expertise in confined space blasting and control of interior blasting lends itself to maritime work on a professional level.
Our types of blasting are based on the standards of our coatings suppliers and will always be designated by the degree of surface preparation required for the materials we are using. The basic standards for preparing metal substrates are a joint effort between the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers International (NACE). A list of standards can be found <a href=http://protective.sherwin-williams.com/pdf/tools-charts-list/surface_preparation_standards.pdf>here</a>, while
SSPC-SP5 / NACE 1 White Metal Blast Cleaning,  SSPC-SP6 / NACE 3 Commercial Blast Cleaning,
SSPC-SP7 / NACE 4 Brush-Off Blast Cleaning are just a few of the standards specified and to which we adhere. Our crews can get you the finish you desire and get it painted as per your needs quickly and on time.<p></p>
As for our crews : Our crews have the required years of experience plus with the mentor-ship of our technicians to keep your job done right. Sandblasting whether on board ship or in a riparian setting is always a good challenge which our crews keenly like to take on.    <p></p>
Constantly investing in new and better equipment is just a sign of a growing successful company and Absolute Blast Corp. is always upgrading their sandblasting equipment, safety equipment and keeping the crews up to date with the right certifications and training. Paramount to Absolute Blast Corp. is it's people. Our crews are typically young family men with strong work ethics and standards who know the company is them. And with that outlook they do their utmost to see that our jobs are done right and you the customer are more than satisfied.
